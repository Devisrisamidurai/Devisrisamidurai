Hi there!

I'm Devisri, a sophomore computer science student with a strong passion for front-end development, DevOps, and open source. I'm a firm believer in the collaborative spirit of open source and I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals in the community and explore new technical frontiers. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn from experienced developers and organizations, and refine my skills in the ever-evolving tech industry.

Excited about CloudNative and Communities❤️!..
